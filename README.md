Old Farmer Simon: A reimagining of the classic "Simon" electronic game using animals instead of colors.
The "tones" from classic simon replaced with high quality premium animal sounds I made with my mouth.
Gameplay involves listening for the sequence of sounds, and then replicating it by pressing the matching animals.
